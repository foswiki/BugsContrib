The [[Bugs.WebHome][Bugs]] web is intended for collecting reports of issues, and then tracking progress towards getting those issues fixed. 
Issues are structured Foswiki topics, where forms are used to store a number of fields that contain data about the issue.

This is an Item Tracking System implemented using %SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms.
It has been implemented to be used in a web on its own, but could be intermingled with a discussion style Web. 
It is a pure Foswiki Data Application implemented using only what you get in the box when you download Foswiki. 

A customised version of it has been in use as TWiki's bug tracking and shakeout system since 2005 - See http://develop.twiki.org/~twiki4/cgi-bin/view/Bugs, and
now also as [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks][Foswiki's tracking system]] since the [[http://foswiki.org/Home/WhyThisFork][Fork]].

The BugsContrib is a _Foswiki Application_ (an application that is implemented entirely in Foswiki topics). 
It is designed to use the left bars supported by %SYSTEMWEB%.PatternSkin and the Foswiki:Extensions.MoveableTypeSkin, 
though could easily be converted to another skin. It's ideal for a small bug database (we have used it with over 4000 items with no problems) for a disciplined team.

The main entry point for examining the list of issues is Bugs.AllOutStandingItems, which can be used to perform general purpose searches over the database. 
You can subdivide the web into different areas using the Bugs.AppliesTo field, and provide each area with its own search topic.


---++ Installation

---+++ Installation Instructions

	* First, check that you do no have an existing web called "Bugs". if you do, move it out of the way.
	* Download the archive from the Plugins web (see below)
	* Unpack it in your Foswiki installation directory. 
	* Make sure that all files are readable by the web server user
	* Run =perl= ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== =install= to automatically check and install other Foswiki modules that this module depends on, that you may not have installed. This script also includes an =uninstall= option should you ever wish to remove the plugin from your installation, and an =upgrade= option that will automatically download and install the latest version.
	* To notify users via email when a report they have created, or are expected to provide feedback for, has changed, modify your crontab entry for the MailerContrib

<verbatim>
0 0 * * *      ( cd /path/to/foswiki/bin && ../tools/genwebnotify && ../tools/mailnotify )
</verbatim>


---++++ Customising the Bugs Web

The web is configured as a simple bug tracker, but can easily be customised to meet your own requirements. Here are some pointers:
   1 Bugs.ItemTemplate contains the basic bug form. This is a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]].
   1 Bugs.WebLeftBar contains the left menu bar
   1 Bugs.AppliesTo contains the list of areas that an issue might apply to. Configure this to your own requirements
   1 [[Bugs.Priority][Priority]] contains a list of valid priorities
   1 Bugs.CurrentState contains a list of valid item states
